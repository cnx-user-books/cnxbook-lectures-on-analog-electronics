  <md:title>Analog Electronics_Lecture 1_Independent and Controlled Sources</md:title>
  <md:abstract>A battery or power socket in our household is an independent source of electric energy.The output of this source is independent of any other electrical parameter in the circuit in which the the independent source is being used. Active Devices such as Vacuum Triode, Tetrode, Pentode, Field Effect Transistor(FET), Bipolar Junction Transistor(BJT) and Operational Amplifiers (Op. Amp)are controlled sources.</md:abstract>

    <para id="id23183223"><emphasis effect="bold">Ans:-</emphasis>When source resistance is much less than the load resistance ( that is less than 1/10 of the minimum load resistance likely to be connected ) then we take the Thevenin Equivalent of the power source. This Thevenin equivalent is an Independent Voltage Source representation of the power source. The open circuit voltage V<sub>OC</sub> at the output terminals is the Thevenin Equivalent Voltage, V<sub>Th</sub> , and the equivalent resistance measured at the output terminals with power supply inactivated is Thevenin resistance R<sub>Th</sub> . Here power supply inactivated means that if we have a voltage source we consider it to be short circuited and if we have a current source we consider it to be open. </para>

    <para id="id19969896">When source resistance is much greater than the load resistance ( that is greater than 10 times of the maximum load resistance likely to be connected ) then we take the Norton Equivalent of the power source. This Norton equivalent is an Independent Current Source representation of the power source. The short circuit current I<sub>SC</sub> at the output terminals is the Norton equivalent current, I<sub>N</sub> , and the equivalent resistance measured at the output terminals with power supply inactivated is Norton resistance R<sub>N</sub> . Here power supply inactivated means that if we have a voltage source we consider it to be short circuited and if we have a current source we consider it to be open circuited. In actual practice it is dangerous to short the output terminals of a power source. It will lead to fuse blow up. Hence short circuit current can be determined only if we are sure that the internal impedance or the source impedance is very high.</para>

    <para id="id21637567">Figure 5 gives the I-V family of curves for a real Triode and ideal Triode. Examining Figure 5b it is clear that Triodeâ€™s family of curves is a family of constant voltage sources. Triode at a given time will behave as one of the constant voltage sources . The grid voltage V<sub>G</sub> will decide which constant voltage source it corresponds. In order that real Triode behaves like a linear circuit element, the family of curves must be equally spaced and equally inclined. A linear Triode when used in an amplifier will give a sinusoidal output for a sinusoidal input. But a real Triode is far from linear. Hence a sine wave input will generate fundamental and harmonics. As the amplitude of input sine wave increases so will the percentage content of the harmonic waves in the output will also increase. Hence this Harmonic Distortion is called Amplitude Distortion. If the input is kept very small then there will be little or no harmonic distortion. How small is very small? In BJT this is less than 5mV and in FET it is less than 400mV. This permissible input voltage range for low level harmonic distortion is referred to as Dynamic Range.</para>

    <para id="id20379355">This comes from network analysis of a given network in S-plane where S-plane is complex frequency plane. Laplace Transformation uses the complex frequency concept . The solution of S-plane analysisleads to complete response of the circuit. The complete response is the sum of transient plus steady state response. This is also known as natural response plus forced response. By Fourier Transform or by treating inductor as jÏ‰L and by treating capacitance as 1/(jÏ‰C) we arrive at steady state sinusoidal response of the network. The total response can be determined by Theory of Operator method also. In this approach the differential equation is set up and its solution determined. When the forcing function is made zero then the differential equation obtained is known as the characteristic equations or homogeneous equation. The roots of this characteristic equation are the poles of the system also known as natural frequencies of the system.These poles can be real or complex hence we say that the poles lie in complex plane. The nature of these poles determine the nature of transient response which is the solution of the characteristic equation or the homogeneous equation known as Complementary Function. This Complementary Function corresponds to the natural response or the transient response in Laplace Transform jargon.In Figure 10 we give the location of poles and its corresponding time-domain transient response.As seen from the Figure, poles in LHP correspond to exponentially decaying type transients which is an indication of stability. On the other hand the poles in RHP correspond to exponentially growing type transients which is an indication of instability which ultimately will lead to catastrophic collapse of the system.</para>
